# Customer-Segmentation-using-k means-clustering
# Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Loads customer data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Explores the data's structure, shape, and missing values.
# Feature Selection:
Selects the 'Annual Income' and 'Spending Score' columns as the features for clustering.
# Determining Optimal Clusters:
Uses the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters based on the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS).
# K-Means Clustering:
Applies the K-Means algorithm to group customers into the identified clusters.
# Visualization:
Creates a scatter plot to visualize the clusters and their centroids, providing insights into customer segments.
In essence, the project leverages K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their financial behavior, enabling businesses to understand their customer base and tailor their strategies accordingly.
